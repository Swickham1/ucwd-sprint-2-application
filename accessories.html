    <p>
        Pedals are option but recommended for electric guitars as they enhance the sound of your guitars through your amp<br /> There are two types of pedals: Digital and analog<br> Digital pedals are good for beginners as they are able to produce many
        effects in one pedal, the only downside is that they might not sound as good as analog<br /> Analog pedals produce one effect at a higher sound quality output and are better for those who know what kind of sound theyre looking for, it is also
        possible to chain analog pedals together to combine multiple effects to your guitar.
